# Docker MCP Test Repository

## Overview

This repository is a test environment for exploring and demonstrating the integration between **Docker** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. This test specifically focuses on understanding how AI assistants can interact with containerized environments and manage code repositories through MCP.

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants to connect to external systems and data sources. It allows AI models like Claude to:

- Access and interact with local development environments
- Read and write files in repositories
- Execute code and tools
- Connect to databases and APIs
- Manage containerized applications

## What This Test Demonstrates

This repository serves as a practical example of:

1. **AI-Driven Repository Management**: How an AI assistant can create and manage GitHub repositories programmatically
2. **Code Generation and Deployment**: Automated creation of Python scripts and documentation
3. **Docker Integration Potential**: Setting up a foundation for containerized development workflows
4. **MCP Workflow Testing**: Validating the connection between AI assistants and development tools

## Repository Contents

- `hello.py` - A simple Python "Hello, World!" script created by the AI assistant
- `README.md` - This documentation file explaining the test setup

## Test Objectives

This test aims to validate:

- ? **Repository Creation**: AI can create GitHub repositories
- ? **File Management**: AI can create and upload files to repositories  
- ? **Documentation**: AI can generate appropriate documentation
- ? **Docker Integration**: Future testing of containerized execution
- ? **MCP Protocol Efficiency**: Measuring response times and reliability

## Running the Test

### Basic Python Script Execution
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/soniccc/check_this_out_docker_mcp_test.git
cd check_this_out_docker_mcp_test

# Run the Python script
python3 hello.py
```

### Future Docker Integration
```bash
# Build Docker container (when Dockerfile is added)
docker build -t mcp-test .

# Run containerized application
docker run mcp-test
```

## Expected Outcomes

This test should demonstrate:

1. **Seamless AI-Repository Integration**: The AI assistant successfully creates and manages repository content
2. **Protocol Reliability**: MCP maintains stable connections during multi-step operations
3. **Development Workflow Enhancement**: Shows how AI can accelerate development setup and documentation

## Technical Notes

- **MCP Version**: Testing with current MCP implementation
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Platform**: GitHub via API integration
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Container Runtime**: Docker (for future integration)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add Dockerfile for containerization
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline testing
- [ ] Add more complex Python applications
- [ ] Test MCP performance under load
- [ ] Document integration patterns

## Contributing

This is a test repository. Feel free to fork and experiment with your own MCP + Docker integrations!
